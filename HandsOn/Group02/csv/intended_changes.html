        <h1>Proposed Changes</h1>
        <p> These are changes that we thought would be necessary after analyzing the csv: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>YEAR
                <ul>
                    <li>Every entry has a year</li>
                    <li>Consistent years (Ex: 200015 is not valid)</li>
                    <li>Two digits (ex: go from 1 (January) to 01)</li>
                </ul>
                <b>NOTE:</b> maybe it is interesting to have an extra column with year and month like 2017-01 
            </li>
            <li>ID
                <ul>
                    <li>There are many buildings that share an id, and those that do not have an id for now we have put (blank), since it is not decided if it is a relevant column such as consumption or the year./li>
                    <li>None of the IDs is repeated (If it is repeated check if it is correct in order to delete the row or modify it)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>TYPE OF BUILDING
                <ul>
                    <li>Every entry has a type of building</li>
                    <li>If there are many types (ex: 800), we try to group them</li>
                    <li>Maybe we should separate the class cultural center from library</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>BUILDING
                <ul>
                    <li>Every entry has a building</li>
                    <li>See if it is convenient to extract the name in a new column (Ex: LIBRARY - PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, perhaps it is more interesting to keep two columns. One with LIBRARY - PHILIPPINE ISLANDS and another with PHILIPPINE ISLANDS)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>ADDRESS
                <ul>
                    <li>Every entry has an adress (If they don't have it, look it up in google maps and fill in manually)</li>
                    <li>Separate between type of road (street, roundabout, square, avenue), number, street name, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>DISTRICT
                <ul>
                    <li>Every entry has a district</li>
                    <li>Coherent districts (Ex: G is not valid)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>DISTRICT CODE
                <ul>
                    <li>Every entry has a district code (If they don't have it, look it up in google maps and fill in manually)</li>
                    <li>Coherent numbers (Ex: 177319284 is not valid)</li>
                    <li>Transform it into number</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Every entry has a neighborhood (If they don't have it, look it up in google maps and fill in manually)</li>
                    <li>Coherent neighborhoods (Ex: asddbka is not valid)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </li>
            <li>NEIGHBORHOOD CODE
                <ul>
                    <li>Every entry has a neighborhood code (If they don't have it, look it up in google maps and fill in manually)</li>
                    <li>Coherent numbers (Ex: 5258222 is not valid)</li>
                    <li>Transform it into number</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Every entry has a coordinate X (If they don't have it, look it up in google maps and fill in manually)</li>
                    <li>Transform it into number or float</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Every entry has a coordinate Y (If they don't have it, look it up in google maps and fill in manually)</li>
                    <li>Transform it into number or float</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                    <li>Transform it into number or float</li>
                    <li>Consistent range (anything outside -180 to +180 is not valid)</li>
                </ul>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <b>NOTE:</b> see if it is important to keep X and Y coordinates as well as longitude and latitude.
            <li>SENSOR
                <ul>
                    <li>delete the column</li>

            </li>
            <li>CLASS
                <ul>
